NAME
====

IO::Path::AutoDecompress - IO::Path with automatic decompression

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use IO::Path::AutoDecompress;

# read lines from a gzipped file transparently
my $io = IO::Path::AutoDecompress.new("foobar.txt.gz");
.say for $io.lines;

# same, but using an .IO like subroutine as a method
my $io = "foobar.txt.gz".&IOAD;
.say for $io.lines;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

IO::Path::AutoDecompress is a module that provides a subclass to `IO::Path`, that will transparently handle compressed files that are compressed with `gzip` (the `.gz` file extension) or `bzip2` (the `.bz2` extension) for the `.slurp` and `.lines` methods.

EXPORTED SUBROUTINES
====================

IOAD
----

The `IOAD` subroutine takes one positional argument and converts that to an `IO::Path::AutoDecompress` object. It is intended to be used in a way similar to the `.IO` method in core.

```raku
use IO::Path::AutoDecompress;

# using the IOAD subroutine as a method
my $io = "foobar.txt.gz".&IOAD;
.say for $io.lines;
```

PREREQUISITES
=============

This module assumes some version of the `gunzip` and `bunzip2` programs can be executed with the `--stdout` argument.
